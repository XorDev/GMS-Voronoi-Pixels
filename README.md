Hey!
I wondered what it would look like if I sampled pixels on a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram). So I used GMS 2.3 to put this shader example together. Maybe you can use it your game to make it look more unique.

Here's the result:

There also other shapes you can try in the shader.

If you happen to use this in your game, please [tweet](https://twitter.com/XorDev) it to me!
